title: Code Breaks... So What Now
description: Get started with the workshop project
---

Welcome to debugging hell! Wait, I mean... welcome to our hands-on workshop. We've got a "slightly broken" application called ErrorFix—a revolutionary marketplace where developers can solve costly errors (ironic, isn't it?). Unfortunately, ErrorFix itself is experiencing a collection of fascinating bugs, from database issues to authentication problems to mysterious transaction failures.

But don't worry—by the end of this workshop, you'll be fixing errors like a pro with Sentry's tools. We'll use stack traces, replays, and even recruit some AI robots with Sentry's Autofix feature.

## Meet ErrorFix: The Buggiest Error Marketplace Ever

ErrorFix is built with Next.js and includes:

- User authentication (when it works)
- Error fix listings to help you solve the hardest code problems (sometimes)
- API endpoints that occasionally decide to take a vacation
- A database connection that's having an existential crisis
- Performance issues that would make a sloth look speedy

These aren't bugs—they're learning opportunities! And we're going to catch every single one.

## Option 1: Running Locally (For the Full Experience)

For the complete debugging adventure, let's run ErrorFix locally:

### 1. Install Node.js (if you haven't already)

First, you'll need Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended):

- **Windows**:

  - Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
  - Accept the default installation options (unless you have a good reason not to)

- **macOS**:
  - Download the macOS installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Run the installer package and follow the instructions
  - Alternatively, if you use Homebrew: `brew install node`

Verify your installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers rather than "command not found" errors.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Now, let's get that buggy code onto your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codyde/ErrorFix-Workshop.git
cd ErrorFix-Workshop
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all those packages that ErrorFix so desperately needs:

```bash
npm install
```

(Grab a coffee—this might take a minute. Dependencies, am I right?)

### 4. Start the Development Server

Launch the application so we can see those errors in all their glory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the Application

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Congratulations! You're now running a broken application. We'll fix it soon, I promise.

## Option 2: StackBlitz (For the Browser Lovers)

Don't want to mess with local setup? No problem! StackBlitz lets you run everything in your browser:

1. Click this magic button to open the project in StackBlitz:

   <a
     href='https://stackblitz.com/github/codyde/ErrorFix-Workshop/'
     target='_blank'
     rel='noopener noreferrer'
   >
     <img
       src='https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg'
       alt='Open in StackBlitz'
     />
   </a>

2. Wait for StackBlitz to set everything up (it's doing all that Node.js/npm stuff automatically)
3. Once loaded, you'll see the application running in the preview panel
4. If the preview doesn't show automatically, click the "Open in New Tab" button to see the app

## Is It Working? (Define "Working")

Now that you've got ErrorFix running (sort of), take a moment to click around and experience our carefully crafted chaos:

1. Just open the page. How long did you wait? Is it snappy?
2. Try adding a few items to the cart. How's that working for you?
3. Alright, let's checkout. There's a demo account which you can use (the admin one). Did you manage to checkout?

## Next Steps

Now that we've got our gloriously broken application up and running, it's time to add some error monitoring. In the [next section](/configure-sentry/), we'll install Sentry to start catching these errors and figuring out what's actually going wrong.
