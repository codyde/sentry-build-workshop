## What We've Covered

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with Sentry's powerful error monitoring and debugging capabilities. Let's recap what we've learned:

### 1. Setting Up Sentry in a Next.js Application

We started by integrating Sentry into our Next.js application, configuring the SDK, and understanding how error tracking works across both client and server components.

### 2. Debugging Real-world Issues

We tackled four common but challenging issues that developers face in production applications:

- **Products API Error Handling**: You learned how to properly capture exceptions in API routes and how to add contextual information to errors for better debugging.

- **Fix Me Button Functionality**: We explored how to trace issues across the frontend and backend, identifying where communication breaks down between components.

- **Authentication Header Mismatches**: You discovered how to monitor authentication flows and capture detailed information about auth failures to quickly resolve session issues.

- **Payment Processing Problems**: We implemented breadcrumbs and custom spans to track user interactions and payment flows, providing visibility into complex transaction processes.

### 3. Advanced Debugging Techniques

Throughout these exercises, you've mastered several advanced debugging techniques:

- Using custom error attributes to provide context for exceptions
- Implementing breadcrumbs to track user journeys
- Creating custom spans to monitor performance and trace transactions
- Leveraging Sentry's trace view to understand the relationship between frontend and backend errors
- Debugging asynchronous operations and API calls

## Final Thoughts

By implementing proper error monitoring and debugging practices as demonstrated in this workshop, you're now equipped to build more resilient applications and provide better experiences for your users. Remember that the most effective debugging strategy is proactive monitoring combined with detailed context gathering.

We hope you found this workshop valuable and that you'll continue exploring Sentry's capabilities to enhance your application development workflow. Happy debugging!
