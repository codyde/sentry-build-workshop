title: Configuring Sentry
description: Set up and configure Sentry in your Next.js application
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Let's face itâ€”your code is going to break. It happens to all of us. The question is: how fast can you fix it when it does? In this section, we'll add Sentry to our Next.js application so we can catch those errors in the wild before our users start tweeting about them.

## Setting Up Sentry

<Steps>
  1. **Run the Sentry CLI Wizard**

     Get Sentry integrated with our ErrorFix application quickly:

     ```bash
     npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
     ```

     This wizard will:
     - Connect to your Sentry account
     - Set up configuration files
     - Create an example error page to test your setup

  2. **Complete the Authentication Process**

     When you run the command, you'll be prompted to authenticate:

     - Choose between browser login (easiest) or an auth token
     - If you don't have a token handy, just go with the browser option
     - The wizard will open your browser and let you log in to Sentry

  3. **Select or Create a Project**

     Choose your Sentry project:

     ![Sentry Project Selection](../../assets/img/4-ProjectCreate.png)

     - If you don't have one yet, the wizard can create it for you
     - Select "Next.js" as the platform

  4. **Choose Features to Enable**

     You'll be asked which features to enable:

     ![Sentry Feature Selection](../../assets/img/5-CLIInstall.png)

     - **Error Monitoring**: Enable to catch runtime errors
     - **Performance Monitoring**: Enable to track app performance
     - **Replays**: Enable to see visual recreations of user sessions
</Steps>

## Understanding Sentry Features

<details>
<summary>Learn More: Error Monitoring</summary>

Error monitoring is the core functionality of Sentry. It allows you to:

- Capture unhandled exceptions in real-time
- See detailed stack traces
- Get context about the user and environment
- Track error frequency and impact
- Assign errors to team members for resolution

When an error occurs, Sentry will show you:
- The exact line of code that failed
- What function was being executed
- The sequence of function calls leading to the error
- What browser/device the user was using
- Custom context you've added to your app

This is essential for quickly identifying and fixing critical issues before they affect more users.

<details>
<summary>Learn More: Performance Monitoring</summary>

Performance monitoring helps you track how your application performs for real users:

- Track page load times
- Monitor API call durations
- Identify slow database queries
- See frontend rendering performance
- Set performance thresholds and alerts

Sentry's performance monitoring creates "transactions" for each significant operation in your app. Each transaction contains "spans" representing smaller operations within it.

This allows you to:
- See which parts of your application are running slowly
- Track performance over time
- Compare performance across different pages and features
- Identify performance regressions after deployments
- Correlate performance issues with errors

By monitoring performance, you can ensure your application not only works but works efficiently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Learn More: Replays</summary>

Replays are like having a video recording of what your users experienced:

- Watch recreations of user sessions leading up to errors
- See exactly what users saw and did
- Identify UI/UX issues that lead to confusion
- Understand complex user interactions that trigger bugs
- Reproduce hard-to-track errors

Replays captures:
- DOM changes
- User interactions (clicks, scrolls, form inputs)
- Console logs
- Network requests

Privacy features ensure sensitive data isn't captured:
- Automatic PII masking
- Customizable privacy rules
- Consent-based recording

This feature dramatically reduces time spent trying to reproduce issues, especially those that depend on specific user interactions or state sequences.

## What Gets Added to Your Project

<Steps>
  1. **Configuration Files for Every Environment**

     The wizard creates specific config files for different execution contexts:

     - `sentry.client.config.js` - For browser errors
     - `sentry.server.config.js` - For server-side rendering/API routes
     - `sentry.edge.config.js` - For edge functions

     Here's what the client configuration looks like:

     ```javascript
     // sentry.client.config.js
     import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

     Sentry.init({
       dsn: "https://your-public-dsn@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
       
       // Capture all errors in development
       tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
       
       // Record 10% of normal sessions, but all error sessions
       replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
       replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
       
       // Replays are only available in the browser
       integrations: [Sentry.replayIntegration()],
     });
     ```

  2. **Updated Next.js Configuration**

     Sentry modifies your Next.js config:

     - Adds Sentry's webpack plugin to `next.config.js`
     - Configures source map uploads
     - Sets up error handling middleware

     ```javascript
     // next.config.js
     const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs');

     const nextConfig = {
       // Your existing config stays here
     };

     module.exports = withSentryConfig(
       nextConfig,
       {
         silent: true, // Less console noise during builds
         org: "your-organization",
         project: "your-project",

         reactComponentAnnotation: {
          enabled: true,
         },
       }
     );
     ```

  3. **App Router Instrumentation**

     Creates or updates `instrumentation.ts` for App Router support:

     ```typescript
     // instrumentation.ts
     export async function register() {
       if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === "nodejs") {
         await import("./sentry.server.config");
       }

       if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === "edge") {
         await import("./sentry.edge.config");
       }
     }
     ```

  4. **Example Error Page**

     Adds a test page at `/sentry-example-page` to verify error capturing
</Steps>

## Testing Your Setup

<Steps>
  1. **Start Your Next.js App**

     Launch your development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

  2. **Visit the Example Page**

     Navigate to the example page created by the wizard (typically `/sentry-example-page`)

     ![Sentry Example Page](../../assets/img/6-ExamplePage.png)

  3. **Trigger Test Errors**

     The example page lets you generate different types of errors:
     
     - Client-side errors
     - Server-side errors
     - API route errors
     
     Click the buttons to trigger errors and see how they appear in your Sentry dashboard.

  4. **Verify in Sentry Dashboard**

     Log in to your Sentry account and check the "Issues" section to see the errors you've triggered. You should see detailed information about each error, including:
     
     - Stack traces
     - Browser/OS information
     - Request data
     - User context (if configured)
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that Sentry is configured in your application, you're ready to start the workshop exercises. These will guide you through common error scenarios and show you how to use Sentry to diagnose and fix them.
