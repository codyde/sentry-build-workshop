So we've got Sentry installed now; great. Let's get set up to properly capture errors. We're jumping right into the code! 

## Houston, We Have Several Problems

Picture this: You visit ErrorFix's marketplace, eager to solve some costly errors (oh, the irony), and... *tumbleweeds*. The product list is emptier than a developer's coffee cup at 4 PM. You click the heroic "Fix Me" button, hoping for salvation, and... *loading spinner of doom*. Then? Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Something's clearly wrong with our product system, but right now we're debugging blind. It's like trying to find a missing semicolon in the dark. 

## Understanding Sentry's Exception Capture

When errors occur in your application, you need more than just a console log. Sentry's exception capture provides rich context that helps you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

## The Case of the Missing Products

Our ErrorFix app has several major crime scenes we need to investigate:

1. **The Ghost Town Marketplace** - Where products should be, but aren't
2. **The Infinite Loading Loop of Doom** - When clicking product links leads to... nowhere
3. **The Authentication Confusion** - When login attempts fail mysteriously
4. **The Payment Predicament** - When checkout process breaks down

Time to add some error tracking and figure out what's actually going wrong. The simplest way to capture an error with Sentry is using the `Sentry.captureException(error)` method:

```javascript
Sentry.captureException(error);
```

This method captures the error and sends it to Sentry, where it can be analyzed and reported.

Let's dive into each issue one by one in the following sections.
