## What We've Covered

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with Sentry's powerful error monitoring and debugging capabilities. Let's recap what we've learned:

### 1. Setting Up Sentry in a Next.js Application

We started by integrating Sentry into our Next.js application, configuring the SDK, and understanding how error tracking works across both client and server components.

### 2. Performance Monitoring and Optimization

We started by investigating performance issues in our Next.js application:

- **Route Performance Analysis**: We identified that our main route was taking over 4.5 seconds to load, which is unacceptable for a marketplace application.
- **Trace View Implementation**: We learned how to use Sentry's trace view to break down performance bottlenecks.
- **Performance Insights**: We discovered that the majority of the slowdown happened while Next.js was rendering the page, not the database queries.

### 3. Debugging Frontend Issues

We tackled a challenging frontend issue with the Add to Cart functionality:

- **Error Context Enrichment**: We learned how to add meaningful context to errors by using `Sentry.setContext()`.
- **Error Handling Best Practices**: We implemented proper error handling with descriptive messages and user feedback.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: We fixed the size selection logic to prevent users from selecting unavailable options.

### 4. Complex Checkout Issues

We solved a complex checkout problem using multiple Sentry features:

- **Seer AI Integration**: We leveraged Sentry's AI-powered debugging to identify root causes.
- **Session Replay**: We used pixel-perfect session recordings to understand user interactions.
- **Breadcrumbs**: We implemented event tracking to trace the sequence of actions leading to errors.
- **Cross-Project Debugging**: We learned how Sentry can connect issues across different parts of your application (frontend and backend).

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

Throughout these exercises, you've mastered several advanced debugging techniques:

- Using custom spans to track performance bottlenecks
- Implementing breadcrumbs to track user journeys
- Leveraging AI-powered debugging with Seer
- Using session replay to understand user interactions
- Adding contextual information to errors
- Debugging across multiple services and platforms

### More Monitoring Solutions

- **[Custom Spans](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/)**: Create custom performance measurements for specific parts of your application.

- **[Trace View](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/trace-view/)**: Get a complete picture of transactions as they propagate through your system.

## Additional Resources

- **[Sentry Documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/)**: Comprehensive guides and API references for all Sentry features.

- **[Sentry Blog](https://sentry.io/blog/)**: Stay updated with the latest features, use cases, and best practices.

- **[Sentry on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry)**: Explore Sentry's open-source repositories and contribute to the project.

## Final Thoughts

By implementing proper error monitoring and debugging practices as demonstrated in this workshop, you're now equipped to build more resilient applications and provide better experiences for your users. Remember that the most effective debugging strategy combines multiple Sentry features:

- Use performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Implement proper error handling with rich context
- Leverage AI-powered debugging for complex issues
- Track user journeys with breadcrumbs and session replay
- Monitor cross-service interactions

We hope you found this workshop valuable and that you'll continue exploring Sentry's capabilities to enhance your application development workflow. Happy debugging!
